### ðŸ”· CTP-EOSâ„¢ Symbol Overview

The default **CTP-EOSâ„¢** symbol is a **blue chrome equilateral upward-facing triangle**.

- **Color Meaning**: The **blue** hue symbolizes **T-energy**, one of the three foundational energy forms within **CTP Energy Science**.
- **Shape Significance**: The **equilateral triangle**, pointing upward, represents the **trenary** (three-fold) nature of CTP Energy.
- **Philosophical and Scientific Roots**:  
  The triangle also pays homage to **Pythagoras**, reflecting a deep respect for the classical sciences of:
  - **Geometry** (including **Sacred Geometry**),
  - **Trigonometry**, and
  - Other mathematical and metaphysical sciences integral to the structure of the universe.

This symbol stands as a unifying icon for the **CTP-EOSâ„¢ Operating System** and the broader vision of **CTP Energy Science**â€”merging advanced energy principles with modern computing.
